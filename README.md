# Digital Geometry Processing - Fall'16 @ UVic

## Course Objectives And Learning Outcomes

Digital 3D geometric models are widely used in computer graphics, entertainment, CAD, architecture, engineering, bio-medicine, and many related fields. This course will follow the digital 3D content creation pipeline. We will first discuss 3D acquisition methods for scanning physical objects. Given this raw geometric data, we analyze and implement several geometry processing methods for data enhancement and manipulation. We will discuss the fundamentals of geometry representations and cover introductory continuous and discrete differential geometry concepts. Polygon mesh representations will be at the center of our investigations. We derive the core processing methods for triangle meshes, such as surface smoothing, parameterization, decimation, remeshing, deformation and registration. The lectures will cover the theory, with a few live-coding sessions. Practical C++/MATLAB exercises will be performed in the labs and homeworks/projects.

## Grading

|**Coursework**  	|**Weight (out of 100%)** | **Tentative Topic** | **Tentative Timeline** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Labs (2h) | 5x3% | Various Topics (in Matlab) | Due before next lab |
| Homework 0 |5% | Matlab and C++ | Due at the end of week 2 |
| Homework 1 |20% | Reconstruction | Due at the end of week 6 |
| Homework 2 |20% | Decimation | Due at the end of week 10  |
| Homework 3 |20% | Deformation |  Due on the last week of class |
| Midterm |20% | Theory + Practice | last week of class |

- The topic of Homework 3 is open for graduate students or with instructor permission. Graduate students will also be required to present their project in the classroom on the last day of class.
- There will be **one midterm** which will cover the theoretical material covered in lectures and reading. You *must pass the midterm* to pass the course.

## Homeworks

* Lab, homeworks and projects are in *Matlab* and *C++*
* Homeworks will be turned in via *GitHub Classroom* (links announced via mailing list)
* Your assignments (regardless of whether they contain solutions or not) should **not be posted in a public repository** (on github, bickbucket, etc..), and doing so is a Copyright violation. Inteasd use private github repositories. You can get unlimited private repositories by subscribing to the [Student Developer Pack](http://education.github.com).
* Code obtained from elsewhere and used as part of an assignment must be documented in the README.md
* Ideas obtained from elsewhere must be referenced in your assignment README.md

The Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FIPPA) dictates that I cannot force you to create a GitHub account, since some of your personal information may then be stored on US servers. As such, if you do not want to use GitHub Classroom I require you to contact me via email **within the first week of class**
